                    I am a self-taught programmer. I did try several languages when I was a teenager but had
                    to throw that aside when I decided to study law. After I left practice, I found more time to relearn
                    programming. I got into python after becoming interested in data science. <br/>
                    I tried to merge these interests in my blog (please visit and subscribe if you like it!) <br/>
                    I am also fairly active on Mastodon, not so much on Twitter.

                    If you worked with enough lawyers, you would know that they don't like technology.
                    Let me try to explain why.

                    We don't tolerate imperfection. Work products have to be flawless and defended vigorously.<br/>
                    As perfectionists, we don't get involved where our output is not ideal. So lawyers become heavily specialised
                    and do not get involved in other areas.

                    To put it in a nice way, a lawyer's job is to manage risk. </br>
                    However, this applies to all aspects of our lives. We don't take kindly to new technology or
                    new methods of working.
